# Recommended Gems for Flatiron School Ruby Developers

### [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form)

Great for taking the repetitiveness out of building forms. It's a DSL you have to learn but once you understand the Rails Form helpers, this saves a ton of time and is bootstrap compatible.

### [Kaminari - Pagination](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari)

Great pagination gem.

### [Friendly ID - URL slugs](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id)

Easy to use slug support in URLs.

### [Acts as Taggable](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on)

I think implementing this yourself is a better idea but this is popular.

### [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic)

NLP for Date Times.

### Geocoder(http://www.rubygeocoder.com/)

For all your geolocation and place normalization needs. I like to use [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to have more control over how the maps look.

### [Paperclip File Upload Option 1](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)

### [Carrierwave File Upload Option 2](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave)

### [Devise - Authentication](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)

### [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)

Rails app configuration gem that simplifies the process of setting up environment configurations for deployment to Heroku.

### [Omniauth](http://intridea.github.io/omniauth/)

Allows for your app to authenticate users through other web applications (such as Twitter, Gmail, Github, etc).
